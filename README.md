# Whatsapp-automation-using-selenium-Python

///////////////////////////////////////////////
 This is a project that I worked on using Python 3.11 . This project can automate Whatsapp by opening it 
 and can also send messages to a particular contact multiple times. Make sure you download chromedriver.exe and selenium server standalone to run this. I worked on Pycharm IDE you can also opt for Visual Studio code or any other IDE you prefer.
